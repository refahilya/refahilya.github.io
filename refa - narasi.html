<p>This is a brief (hope so) introduction about myself :D</p>
<p>My name is Refa Hilyah Auliya. And yes, it's Refa with f. 
  Sometimes I found it little annoying how people often get it wrong and write it with v instead. 
  Move on to the date I was born. I born in 10 August 2004 in Sidoarjo, East Java (But my birth certificate said I was born in Surabaya. Should be a misinformation, but... Who cares??ðŸ¤·) 
  Although I born there (East Java), but I live in Central Java. And I grateful about that, truly. 
  Next, my address is on Karang Tengah, Waleng, Girimarto, Wonogiri. No street name because I live in such village that unknown by the world, so only nameless street. 
  Living in unknown village does not mean I am uneducated. There are so many schools here dude, and I have to admit it, I was one of lucky people that born in melek-pendidikan family. 
  Then in my 5th years of my life, my parent send me to kindergarten. Elementary school in the next year, middle school in the next six years, high school in the next three years, 
  andd, in the 18th years of my life, I finally going to University. <br> <br>
  Until now, I still attending my lectures in UNS. My majority is informatics and computer engineering education. Like computer engineering... but in educational purpose. 
  In this majority, I learn many things. Proggramming is one of them. SO far, I only can do proggramming in python and a bit in html. 
  I'll study harder and learn more so that I can reach my dream career. Wish me luck! 
  Here's some picture of me with my almamater on: <br>
